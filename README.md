## _What is it?_
This project is a functional Todo list application utilizing class components and the Web Storage API.
## _What does it show?_
This project demonstrates my (Mehmed Schaalan) ability to use class components to properly store and set state, use the Web Storage API to store the data in localStorage, and use callback functions passed as props to do so.




# Introduction
Todolistx is performed particularly handy by JavaScript coding interactive lists that let users add, remove items, something you can’t do with HTML and CSS alone.
1.  Managing ToDo items of each user.


2.  Setting access rights of each user within the application.

Todolistx or "Checklists" are the _best_ way of tracking tasks. <br />
Atul Gawande wrote a _superb_ book on this subject: <br />
